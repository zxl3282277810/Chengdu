# Chengdu
I like this city.This is my place And this is my second repository.
I have fallen in love with a beautiful girl in my hometown.But she had a boyfriend now.They all lived in Changsha,a historical and cultural city in Hunan province.

After two years later,I come back and read there words I writed two years ago,I find it is so funny and sweet. Now I also have a grilfriend who loves me deeply like most of my frinens. When Iã€€came back and watch these old times,I came to think that its the happiest time in my life. I waste a large of time on boring things. But I can't change anthing except accept the fact that I have changed a lot and lost something. And I would never find them back. What a sad story it is! But everyone must look forward to life and accept themselves. Life must going on.
